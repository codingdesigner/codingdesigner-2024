Over the last 20+ years I've been a designer, developer, creative director, front end architect, design systems specialist, featured conference speaker, manager, and mentor.

Most recently I've been a leader in creating design systems to solve global brand needs. Leaning on my skills as a lead engineer, creative designer, and manager.

I live in the beautiful Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia, PA with my teenager next to a gorgeous park with miles of trails. In a previous life I was a touring musician playing in punk and jazz bandsand I'm still an avid collector of vinyl records, which I love to play while I work. In my free time I love to spend time with friends and family, and advocate for LGBTQIA issues.
