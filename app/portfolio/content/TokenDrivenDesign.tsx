        <p>In building design systems, I rely heavily on a token-driven approach, which allows every design element to be defined by specific tokens. For example, in the card components that I developed, I annotated each `color` and `type` token to illustrate how foundational design consistency can be achieved across varied applications. This method not only streamlines the development process but also fortifies the designâ€™s adaptability.</p>
