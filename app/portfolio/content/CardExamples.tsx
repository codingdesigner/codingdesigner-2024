      <h2>Multi-brand theming through design tokens</h2>
      <ParagraphWrapper>
        <p>Understanding the need for brands to maintain distinct identities yet operate under a singular corporate umbrella, I engineered a solution using "Brand Identity" JSON files. This system allows each brand at Cond√© Nast to have its own unique design elements, tailored through the JSON file, while sharing a common structural base.</p> <p>This approach not only simplifies brand differentiation but ensures that any component within our design system can connect flawlessly with different brands, enhancing both usability and brand coherence.</p>
