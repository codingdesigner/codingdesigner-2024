### Token-driven design
Each component in the design system is styled using a set of design tokens. Below is a Card component with each of the `color` and `type` tokens annotized.

### Multi-brand theming through design tokens
Each brand's design is controled via a "Brand Identity", allowing for any component in the design system to work with every brand.

### Fine-tuned editorial expression with flexible expressive layouts

Using design tokens and layout configurations gives editors plenty of control over the expressiveness of the brand, and of each piece of content within it.
