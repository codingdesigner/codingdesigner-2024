## About
Giant design systems.

Responsive Web Design, UX and Visual Design, CSS, Sass, and React specialist who has been designing and building websites since the early days of the web. I've designed countless sites, written a custom content management system, and am an active member of the Sass and Drupal communities. I ran the Philadelphia Sass meetup and the Philadelphia Responsive Web Design meetup. I currently help run the Front End Philly Meetup.

I've been a Sass user and vocal enthusiast for over four years. I'm the creator behind Breakpoint, co-creator of Sassy Modular Scale, and author of many articles on Sass and Responsive Web Design for The Sass Way.

I also built one of the dumbest Sass experiments, sassymothereffingtextshadow.com

I'm an active public speaker, and speak regularly at large and small events about web design, both from a creative and technical point of view.

I do nearly all of my web design "in the browser" using tools like css as creative tools.

Specialties: Responsive Web Design, UX and Visual Design, Sass, Drupal, CSS3, HTML5, Javascript, git, Art Direction, Graphic Design, Design in the browser

## Projects

### SCORE.org

Jan 2016

Associated with Phase2

* Designed a new design language and site for SCORE.org

I worked with SCORE to realign their design to their brand. Through discovery exercises and research I learned that the relationships they facilitate between experienced business mentors and entrepreneurs is at the core of everything they do. The arrows that point between different content items and sections are subtle reminders of those relationships.

I also wanted to connect with entrepreneurs and their passion for their businesses. The moment when an entrepreneur first holds their own business card is the moment when their dreams start to feel real. I wanted to bring that reality to this site. So I made real letterpress business cards and photographed them for the site header. The result is more tangible, and suggests that we’re ready to get down to business.

## Recommendations

### From Suzi Arnold
Gwen is a powerful weapon. I have had the pleasure of working with her at both NBC and Phase2 and look forward to the time our professional paths cross again.

I really believe Gwen's design background has made her a stronger developer and her development experience has improved her designs skills in ways that are key in the way we build things today. Hers is a rare talent. Pair that with the fact that she's smart and really fun to work with and Gwen is someone any company is lucky to have.
