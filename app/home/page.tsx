          <p className={typography.leadIn}>
            I’ve spent over two decades doing all aspects of web design and development, leading to my focus and passion in developing <strong>large, impactful design systems.</strong> I’ve had the privilege of leading projects for prestigious brands like <strong><a href="./portfolio">Condé Nast</a> and NBC</strong>, utilizing my core skills in Leadership and mentoring, UX, Visual and Responsive Design, CSS, Sass, and React. These skills and experiences have been essential in bringing some of the world’s best known websites to life.
          </p>
          <p className={typography.leadInColor}>
            I revel in tackling the big juicy design system challenges.

          <ParagraphWrapper>
            <p>
              From the start of my career, I’ve been deeply involved in community-building, leading meetups focused on Sass and design in Philadelphia and New York. I love contributing to the community and have developed tools like Sass Breakpoint and co-created Sassy Modular Scale. I’ve also shared my knowledge through numerous articles for The Sass Way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Public speaking is another one of my joys &mdash; I like to discuss how creative visions can be seamlessly integrated with technical executions in web design. I do most of my design work directly in the browser, turning CSS into a playground of creative possibilities.

          <ParagraphWrapper>
            <p>
              I specialize in creating design systems that meet the needs of large organizations. Whether that’s a design agency needing to more efficiently deliver projects to many clients, or a global media company with household name brands, no challenge is too intimidating. Instead, these are the challenges that are the most exciting to dive into. I enjoy working with large and small focused teams, and revel in the thrill of seeing a big project meet the world.
